# Vanilla JS Carousel

## Potential Improvements

- Actually make it more like a slideshow: messing with positioning and, likely, visibility to animate the transition. That might require keeping track of whether it will animate in from the left or out from the right. Would need to keep track of one more piece of state to ensure animation direction is correct.
